# Mobility Analaysis project

## Overview
**Important Note :** I have done this project for a client and I have only shared the things that are not confidential.
This project is about analyzing urban mobility data to extract important insights and make data-driven decisions.

You can find many exciting things like how to process mobility data, create flow datasets, create heatmaps and find urban bottlenecks.

## Key Achievements

Processed many GB of mobility data and extracted valuable insights.
Built Dashboards and visuals which helped the client take critical decisions.
Used Machine Learning to find bottlenecks and helped the company increase its revenue.


## Architecture of the project
You can find 3 notebook folders: 
- Exploratory data notebooks: Where I ingested the data and explored it.
- Preprocessing data notebooks: Where I cleaned each of the 3 data samples and visualized it
- Analysis notebooks: Where I analyzed the data to extract its quality and make dashboards and reports.


## Data Quality & Analysis Overview

### a. Key Information Extracted

- Temporal range of the data.
- Null values per column.
- Geographical distribution of the data.

### b. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
