# Mobility Analysis project

## Overview
**Important Note :** I have done this project for a client and I have only shared the things that are not confidential.
This project is about analyzing urban mobility data to extract important insights and make data-driven decisions.

You can find many exciting things like how to process mobility data, create flow datasets, create heatmaps and find urban bottlenecks.

## Key Achievements

- Processed many GB of mobility data and extracted valuable insights.

- Built PowerBI Dashboards and visuals which helped the client take critical decisions.

- Performed a spatial analysis on mobility data, where the scope was limited to specific, pre-defined areas for an in-depth comparative study.

## Architecture of the project
You can find 3 notebook folders: 
- Exploratory data notebooks: Where I ingested the data and explored it.
- Preprocessing data notebooks: Where I cleaned each of the 3 data samples and visualized it
- Analysis notebooks: Where I analyzed the data to extract its quality and make dashboards and reports.
